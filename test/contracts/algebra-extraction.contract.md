Implementation fence: `Effect4/Algebra/**`

Battery: `Effect4Test/Algebra/ExtractionContract.lean`

Counterexamples: `test/counterexamples/REGISTER.md`, rows `E4-ALG-CE-001`
through `E4-ALG-CE-008`

## Degree and claim boundary

I have shown algebraically that this slice can be implemented to the degree of:

- kernel-checked constructor, monad, interpretation, sum, universal-property,
  and handler-composition equations;
- an explicit universe policy that prevents construction of a program which
  its handler kind cannot interpret;
- exact source-span and byte-digest provenance for every Foldlab declaration
  being extracted; and
- executable Lean falsifiers for the public surface and representative
  mutations.

This packet does not claim that the higher-order `Program` proof carrier is
serializable, that a bounded runner is compositional, or that TypeScript host
code has been preserved. Those are separate first-order-flow and conformance
obligations.

Obligation classes: **domain, contract, adequacy, termination, abstraction,
conformance, claim-scope**. There is no mutable-state frame inside the algebra;
the repository frame below still applies.

The original generic tests are the PDD-7/PDD-8 contracts and attacks, the
generic adversaries in `SumAlgebra.lean:643–1022`, and the `Ct`, `RUnit`,
`Collapse`, drifting-interpreter, missing-operation-agreement, and minimal
tower witnesses in `Universal.lean`. CAS-specific failures, `RefM`, and byte
observations are deliberately excluded from this slice.

## CATEGORIES

Assigned and added by the breaker:

- `contracts` — CATALOG §1.4: an exported theorem must state everything a
  client may rely on;
- `wp-sp-calculus` — §2.6: interpretation of sequencing preserves order;
- `inductive-data` — §4.2: `pure` and `vis` constructor equations are the
  proof carrier's defining equations;
- `lemmas-proofs` — §5.2: no bodyless law or circular proof counts;
- `algebraic-laws` — §§6.2 and 7.2: units, associativity, homomorphism, and
  reconstruction;
- `specification-design` — §8.0: the conjunction of laws, not one favorable
  equation, is the meaning;
- `abstraction-modules` — §§9.2, 9.3, and 9.5: the export is closed and every
  operation commutes with interpretation;
- `proof-mechanics` — §B.7: every program, operation, handler, and target in
  the stated range is quantified, not sampled.

## Existing-type disposition

There is exactly one generic signature, program, and handler family in
Effect4. The new library owns them. A later Foldlab adapter may alias them or
define conversions with two round-trip theorems; it may not make a second
generic semantic carrier. Foldlab keeps CAS operations, answer definitions,
refusals, words, reference handlers, and canonical bytes until their own
closure rows are complete.

`Program` remains the well-founded higher-order W-tree proof carrier: its
continuation is a Lean function from the operation's answer. Every selected
branch is structurally well-founded, but an infinite answer type permits
infinitely many immediate children and a continuation family whose selected
branches have no uniform finite depth bound. First-order graph/program content
is a separate later type with an explicit embedding. No `Serialize`,
`DecidableEq`, hash identity, or raw `Lean.Expr` field belongs on `Program`.

## Public declaration signature proposal

argument roles, result types, and theorem propositions may not. The public
surface lives in namespace `Effect4`.

The Lean battery repeats every declaration above as an exact type ascription.
The ascriptions fix signature universes, argument roles, binder types, result
types, and complete theorem propositions. Bare name checks are insufficient:
they still elaborate after a theorem acquires an unrelated conjunct. Separate
definitional-equality witnesses pin the bodies of `LeftUnit`, `RightUnit`, and
`BindAssoc`, whose constant types alone are only `Prop`.

The main ergonomic theorems use `[LawfulMonad M]`. Sharp companion theorems
may accept only the equations they consume (`LeftUnit`, `RightUnit`, and
`BindAssoc`). The weaker forms are not permission to call every bare `Monad`
lawful.

### Universe policy

For a fixed signature `S : Signature.{uOp,uAns}`, both every answer and every
program result are in `Type uAns`, and every handler target has kind
`Type uAns → Type v`. This alignment is intentional. It removes Foldlab's
constructible-but-not-interpretable shape: a `Program S A` cannot be formed at
a result universe which the target `M` cannot consume.

A client needing larger results declares or explicitly lifts a signature at
the larger answer universe. Mixed-universe sum is not silently inserted in
this slice. Any later `Signature.lift` must come with program/handler
translations and both round trips; it is not an implicit coercion.

## REQUIRES

- Lean toolchain is exactly `leanprover/lean4:v4.33.1`.
- The package depends on Lean core and Std only for this slice, unless a
  separately pinned dependency acceptance record is committed first.
- All signatures combined by `sum` share the same answer universe.
- Target `M` is a `Monad` for interpretation and satisfies exactly the monad
  equations named by each theorem.
- Effect4 imports no Foldlab module; Foldlab source is provenance and an
  external compatibility target only.

## ENSURES

Each law has a stable ID used by the falsifier table.

- `E4-ALG-L01` — program left unit:
  `bind (pure a) f = f a`.
- `E4-ALG-L02` — program right unit:
  `bind p pure = p`.
- `E4-ALG-L03` — program associativity:
  `bind (bind p f) g = bind p (fun a => bind (f a) g)`.
- `E4-ALG-L04` — one operation followed by `k` reconstructs `vis`:
  `bind (perform op) k = vis op k`.
- `E4-ALG-L05` — interpretation preserves pure:
  `interpret h (pure a) = pure a`.
- `E4-ALG-L06` — interpretation preserves one operation:
  `interpret h (perform op) = h.handle op`.
- `E4-ALG-L07` — interpretation preserves bind:
  `interpret h (bind p f) = interpret h p >>= fun a => interpret h (f a)`.
- `E4-ALG-L08` — identity interpretation reconstructs syntax:
  `interpret identityHandler p = p`.
- `E4-ALG-L09` — a summed handler is determined by both projections; left
  and right operations use their corresponding handler, and those two
  equations uniquely determine the sum.
- `E4-ALG-L10` — signature injections preserve pure and bind, are injective,
  and interpretation through a summed handler commutes with injection.
- `E4-ALG-L11` — injection adequacy: the initial target instance pins any
  candidate satisfying the interpretation square to `Program.inl` or
  `Program.inr`; a favorable target alone is not enough.
- `E4-ALG-L12` — freeness: every monad morphism out of `Program S` is induced
  by exactly one handler, assuming the right-unit equation needed to recover
  handler operations.
- `E4-ALG-L13` — initiality is claimed only in the category of `S`-models:
  for a fixed handler, `interpret` is the unique monad morphism that agrees
  with that handler on operations. `Program S` is not claimed initial among
  bare monads.
- `E4-ALG-L14` — interpreter adequacy: morphism laws plus agreement on every
  single operation pin a candidate interpreter pointwise to `interpret`.
- `E4-ALG-L15` — handler towers collapse:
  `interpret lower (interpret upper p) =
   interpret (upper.through lower) p`.
- `E4-ALG-L16` — `through` is associative across typed source/intermediate/
  target signatures and has identity handlers as categorical units.
- `E4-ALG-L17` — `through` is a monoid only on endomorphisms
  `Handler S (Program S)`; cross-signature handlers form category-shaped
  composition, not one monoid carrier.
- `E4-ALG-L18` — universe closure: for fixed `S`, `Program S A` and
  `Handler S M` use the same input universe `uAns`; the mismatched form in the
  battery is rejected.

## DECREASES

- `Program.bind`, `Program.inl`, `Program.inr`, `interpret`, and the proofs of
  their laws recurse structurally on the input `Program`.
- No fuel participates in these definitions. There is no loop constructor in
  this slice.
- Structural recursion proves well-foundedness, not global finiteness. The
  `E4-ALG-CE-008` witness has infinitely many distinct root children with
  unbounded finite depths.
- `Handler.sum` and `Handler.through` are non-recursive.
- Any implementation whose recursion is hidden behind a dependency must
  expose an eliminator/fold with the same structural termination argument.

## FRAME

- Reads: the pinned Foldlab source spans and the public Lean/Std interfaces.
- Writes for the builder: only `Effect4/Algebra/**` and matching builder-owned
  test-runner wiring.
- Breaker-owned, read-only to the builder: this packet,
  `Effect4Test/Algebra/ExtractionContract.lean`, and the counterexample rows.
- Must not change: Foldlab files, CAS-specific types or semantics, Effect4
  Schema/Flow/Runtime modules, generated bytes, TypeScript surfaces, or the
  central counterexample IDs.
- Pure functional frame: no state, IO, clock, scheduler, `Lean.Expr`, or host
  runtime object enters the generic algebra.

## FALSIFIER

| Law | Exhibit that kills it | Executable site |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L01 | `a,f` with `bind (pure a) f ≠ f a` | `ExtractionContract.lean`, lawful-monad snapshot |
| L02 | `p` with `bind p pure ≠ p` | same |
| L03 | `p,f,g` whose two bind associations differ | same |
| L04 | `op,k` with `bind (perform op) k ≠ vis op k` | same |
| L05 | `h,a` with `interpret h (pure a) ≠ pure a` | same |
| L06 | `h,op` with `interpret h (perform op) ≠ h.handle op` | concrete state-handler case |
| L07 | `h,p,f` whose interpreted bind square does not commute | two-operation state-handler case |
| L08 | `p` with `interpret identityHandler p ≠ p` | public theorem snapshot |
| L09 | a sum handler that swaps or discards one branch while passing the other projection | concrete `swappedSum` witness; `E4-ALG-CE-001` |
| L10 | an injection that drops/reorders syntax, fails a monad law, is non-injective, or changes interpretation | theorem snapshots and concrete left injection |
| L11 | `ι ≠ inl` satisfying only a weakened/favorable interpretation condition | initial-target uniqueness snapshot; `E4-ALG-CE-002` |
| L12 | a monad morphism with no inducing handler, or two inducing handlers | free-property snapshot; axiom audit required |
| L13 | two distinct monad morphisms into one bare monad refuting unqualified initiality | `E4-ALG-CE-003` |
| L14 | (a) interpreter ignores `h` but preserves monad structure, or (b) agrees on operations but drifts on a two-op program | `E4-ALG-CE-002/003`; both hypotheses are required |
| L15 | `upper,lower,p` whose nested and composed interpretations differ | concrete state-handler tower and theorem snapshot |
| L16 | typed `upper,middle,lower` with unequal associations or failed identity | category theorem snapshots |
| L17 | a cross-signature pair for which the alleged monoid binary operation is ill-typed | `E4-ALG-CE-004` |
| L18 | `Small : Signature.{0,0}` and `Program Small Type` elaborates | guarded elaboration rejection; `E4-ALG-CE-005` |

`E4-ALG-CE-008` is a claim-scope attack rather than a new algebraic law. Its
executable `Nat`-answer witness rejects any description of `Program` as
globally finite while preserving the inductive W-tree carrier and every
theorem above.

lake env lean Effect4Test/Algebra/ExtractionContract.lean
```

Expected current result: nonzero at the first missing
`Effect4.Algebra.Signature` import. After the builder supplies the frozen
surface, this same file must elaborate with no messages. Axiom inspection of
all exported theorem declarations and a clean `lake build` are additional
acceptance gates; successful elaboration alone is not the final claim.

## Closure graph

No cutover row closes until all incoming edges below are green.

```text
Signature.sum
  -> Handler.sum projections -> Handler.sum uniqueness
  -> Program injections -> injection morphism laws
     -> interpretation/injection squares -> injection uniqueness

Program constructors -> bind -> LawfulMonad
  -> interpret constructor equations -> interpret_bind
  -> IsMonadMorphism -> existence + handler uniqueness
  -> freeness + initiality-in-S-models + interpreter pin

identityHandler + interpret_bind
  -> Handler.through -> interpret_through
  -> category associativity + left/right identity
  -> endomorphism-only monoid

Signature answer universe = Program result universe = Handler input universe
  -> every constructible Program is in the domain of its Handler kind
```

## Breaks

No implementation has yet been attacked. Add only witnessed break records in
the `BROKE / LAW / WITNESS / CLASS / FIXED-BY` format; never delete them.
