# Well-founded effect programs

`Program` is the higher-order proof carrier: continuations are Lean
functions. It is an inductive, well-founded tree and supports structural
recursion, but it need not have finitely many nodes or a uniform depth bound
when an operation has infinitely many answers. It intentionally has no
decidable equality, serialization, or content identity.
