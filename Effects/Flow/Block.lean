# First-order flow blocks

This module owns the nominal identities, closed operation alphabet, and raw
block terms used by flow admission. Raw terms contain only stable identities;
they deliberately contain no Lean continuation or semantic `Program`.

/--
A closed operation alphabet supplied at the admission boundary.

Raw flows retain only `id`. Executable lookup and its two inverse laws remain
in this trusted semantic environment, so no host function enters canonical
flow content.
